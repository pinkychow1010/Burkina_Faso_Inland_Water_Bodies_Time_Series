# eo2cube: Burkina Faso Surface Water Bodies Analysis

This repository includes example scripts contributed as a graduate research assistant on [eo2cube](https://datacube.remote-sensing.org/) project, which aims to create an innovative data analysis infrastructure, supporting agencies and scientific institutions by reducing the complexity and effort that comes with processing Big Data. The contributed code is aimed for DataCube for Burkina Faso, which is under [WASCAL](https://wascal.org/) (West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use) research project.

It includes a NDCI-based cloud masking algorithm and a library water_ts with functions developed for analysing water dynamics and time series for inland lake bodies.
